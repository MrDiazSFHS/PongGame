# BouncingBallClass

In this project you will write a program using [Processing](https://processing.org) to create the Pong Game. Be sure to take time to give your game additional functionality (two bars, multiple balls, MousePressed, MouseReleased, Key Strokes, color, line color, tracing, bouncing of each other, etc). 

When you are happy with the appearance of your project, you will post your finished program on a website. You can get a free [GitHub](https://github.com) account for your website. Instructions on how to put your program on a GitHub website are on slides [GitHub Instructions](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ixFGgkEH7pFzWNaX8LePapQFWQg0BbsdVZMflQqHeSU/edit?usp=sharing). Submit the link to your website on google classroom.
